                        Of all applications of computing, it is undeniable that Microsoft
                        Powerpoint has had the largest beneficial impact on society. From
                        school presentations, teaching, to professional meetings and the vast
                        world of business, Microsoft Powerpoint has stretched its presence
                        into every one of our lives, and changed it for the better. Without
                        its stunning, elegant slides which concisely convey only ever the most
                        important information, it is only obvious the world would be lagging
                        10 years<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>
                        behind its current advancement.

                        Microsoft PowerPoint was originally conceived by a company called
                        Forethough Inc. and was intended to be used strictly in business
                        presentations. Microsoft however, in their infinite foresight and
                        wisdom, realised the true power of the application, acquiring PowerPoint
                        just 3 months after its inception. After being acquired, the program
                        quickly expanded into all sectors of society, from schools and universities,
                        to briefing military operations in the Iraq war. At the same time,
                        it began to dominate the world of professional business, as the program
                        was originally catered towards business presentations - it mimiced the
                        format and style of the business presentations of the time. Nowadays,
                        PowerPoint continues to dominate the presentation sector, with a market
                        share of 95%<sup>[<a href="#marketShareReference">reference</a>]</sup>.

                    <p>
                        PowerPoint quickly took over the business world on release, since it
                        had been targeted at that audience originally - mimicing the same format
                        and style of existing presentations. It instantly became a ubiquitous
                        tool as it greatly streamlined the process of business meetings and
                        presentations. The sheer amount of hours of human labour PowerPoint made available
                        could rival the discovery of fire, which allowed humans to cook and reduce
                        time spent hunting for food. As PowerPoint spread into uses beyond
                        business, so did its positive impact; its omnipresence in education
                        to present information in an easily-digestable format
                        has evidently bred a generation of smarter children - like the peer-reviewers
