                        Of all applications of computing, it is undeniable that Microsoft
                        Powerpoint has had the largest beneficial impact on society. From
                        school presentations, teaching, to professional meetings and the vast
                        world of business, Microsoft Powerpoint has stretched its presence
                        into every one of our lives, and changed it for the better. Without
                        its stunning, elegant slides which concisely convey only ever the most
                        important information, it is only obvious the world would be lagging
                        10 years<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>
                        behind its current advancement.

                        Microsoft PowerPoint was originally conceived by a company called
                        Forethough Inc. and was intended to be used strictly in business
                        presentations. Microsoft however, in their infinite foresight and
                        wisdom, realised the true power of the application, acquiring PowerPoint
                        just 3 months after its inception. After being acquired, the program
                        quickly expanded into all sectors of society, from schools and universities,
                        to briefing military operations in the Iraq war.
