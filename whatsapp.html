                <p>
                    Pheidippides was a Greek runner who, according to legend, ran from the Battle of 
                    Marathon to Athens to announce victory, inspiring the modern marathon race.

            <p style="font-size: 14px;">
            Unfortunately, Pheidippides died upon reaching his destination due to physical exhaustion.
            However, with WhatsApp, Pheidippides wouldn't have had to travel the 26 miles and instead 
            could have just sent a text instantly.

    <h3><u>End-to-End Encryption</u></h3>
            <p>
                Since the start of the century as SMS texting began getting more popular, there have 
                been multiple reports of texts being intercepted and read by the government (
                <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/intercept-text-messages-spy-nsa-gchq-british-phone">Channel 4 Spy Report</a>
                ).
                <br>
                WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the intended recipients can read the messages you send.
                <ol>
                    <li>Key Exchange: When you first set up WhatsApp, the app generates a pair of encryption keys â€“ a public key and a private key. The public key is shared with your contacts, while the private key remains on your device.</li>
                    <li>Signal Protocol: WhatsApp employs the Signal Protocol, a highly regarded encryption protocol, to encrypt messages and calls. Each message or call is protected with a unique session key.</li>
                    <li>Secure Transmission: When you send a message, your device encrypts it using the recipient's public key. Only the recipient's device, with the corresponding private key, can decrypt and read the message. This ensures that even WhatsApp itself cannot access the content of your messages.</li>
                    <li>Forward Secrecy: WhatsApp employs forward secrecy, which means that even if someone were to obtain your encryption keys in the future, they cannot decrypt past messages, as each message is encrypted with a unique session key.</li>
                    <li>Authentication: Messages are not only encrypted but also authenticated to prevent tampering or spoofing. This ensures that the sender and content remain secure during transmission.</li>
                    <li>Group Chats: Group chats in WhatsApp also benefit from end-to-end encryption. Each group has a shared encryption key, and individual messages within the group are encrypted and decrypted using this key.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                WhatsApp is not the only application that uses end-to-end encryption, but it is one of the best examples of how computational thinking and computational power has been used to bring a service to the 
                masses that allows for private communication.
