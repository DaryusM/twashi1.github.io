	<h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
	<p>NFT stands for "non-fungible token", and is an <i>identifier</i> of sorts which is recorded on a blockchain. NFTs can be transferred, meaning they can be sold. Due to NFTs being inherently non-fungible (and therefore one of a kind), they can theoretically be worth a lot of money.</p>
	
	<h3>How do NFTs make a positive contribution to society?</h3>
